# Mixing Potions

Mixing potions was born of desire to connect people with common interest around the use of alternative medicine, and more specific essential oils through a social platform that enables them to create and share their experiences using this products in a user friendly and easy to understand manner.

The project is a continuation of my Project 3 and more specific Project 4 which touched the same topic, but in a different manner.
Website will be used by my wife to follow her passion in alternative medicine and more specific, her passion for doTTera products.

Project is connected to the backend components created in the backend portion of the project found here:
